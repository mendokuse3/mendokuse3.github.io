## The Game 

This game is essentially a computerized version of whack-a-mole, but also draws from aim training maps found in games such as Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.  In this version, targets pop up at random and you have to click each one before it disappears.  At the start, there are options to customize the settings of the game.

[Whack-a-mole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whac-A-Mole) is a game that most people have played at some point in their lives.  Moles pop up from holes at random and you have to hit each one before it goes back down.
